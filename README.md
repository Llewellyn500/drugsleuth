Welcome to my revolutionary AI-powered tool, designed with a single mission: to help you identify the drugs prescribed to you with ease and accuracy. Whether you're a healthcare professional or a concerned patient, my tool offers an intuitive and reliable solution to drug identification. This project, crafted with dedication and expertise, is a part of my Computer Science mini-project at KNUST, showcasing the incredible potential of AI in transforming healthcare. Join me on this journey to make medication management simpler and safer for everyone.
